# hello-world
Just a sample repository to get started

26 years old and just getting started on Github. I have along way to go but I'm very ambitious. Have two years of experience under my belt working with computer hardware and project management. My education was in the field of engineering and math is my specialty. I enjoy coding with C++ and I work primarilty in Linux based environments.
